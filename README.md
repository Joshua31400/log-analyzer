## ðŸ“š About the project

This project was developed for a personal student dev-ops project. The goal was to create a log analyzer in Go. With web interface, the user can upload a log file and get some statistics graphically.

I don't finish the project yet, but the next steps are:
- A save and show graph system
- Refactor the code
- Add more statistics
- Add a user system
- Add a log file history
- Add a log file download system
- Add a log file delete system
- Add mor analyze options of the log file

_The curent project repository can be founded [here](https://github.com/Joshua31400/log-analyzer)_
